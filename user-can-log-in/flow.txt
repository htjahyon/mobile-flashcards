* User Can Stay Signed In *
Nothing is being called in the server. Nothing is done to the database. In the client,
however, the decode-token.js handles the token as the user refreshes the page. The user
can still access the website under the same username.

* User Can Sign Out *
Nothing is being called in the server. Nothing is done to the database. In the client,
however, the navbar.jsx handles the sign out. Once the user signs out, the webpage shows
the sign-in and sign-out options.
